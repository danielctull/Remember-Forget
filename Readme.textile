h1. Remember/Forget

This project adds memory management back to ARC, also giving an accurate "rememberCount". I had to use "remember" and "forget" because the compiler complains about using retain and release.

To use, simply call remember and forget on an object:

<pre>NSDate *date = [NSDate dateWithTimeIntervalSince1970:-11491632000];
[[date remember] remember];
	
// Though we should always remember this date, we do actually forget it:
[date forget];
[date forget];</pre>



*It's a joke, get over it*

*AND REALLY DON'T USE IT*
